== Changelog ==

= 1.2.4 =
* Changes the API base URL from http to https

= 1.2.3 =
* Replaces deprecated *create_function* with anonymous function

= 1.2.2 =
* Includes start and end params for function that builds a URL query
* Adds sponsor and tags as additional items to pull from the API
* Ensures limit option gets set - otherwise causes php warning that variable is unset.

= 1.2.1 =
* Adds code to test if the plugin's functions and classes already exist, to help avoid errors in instances where the plugin code might be packaged into a theme or another plugin outside of Wordpress's plugin manager. This release otherwise adds no new or changed featues.

= 1.2.0 =
* This is released as a minor update because the widet now properly uses the before_widget and after_widget parameters. In the process, the hard-coded widget_meta CSS class has been dropped.

This version also allows the widget to set the header tag, which default to h2.
